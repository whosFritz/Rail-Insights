## Reporting a Vulnerability ðŸš¨

Please report security vulnerabilities to this e-mail address: ducktech0815@duck.com. 
If you have found a security vulnerability or similar, this is the only and best way to inform us. 
#### Please do not open an issue on GitHub, we will take care of that in case of doubt.

## Expectations when reporting a security vulnerability

1. Response time: We strive to process all reported vulnerabilities as quickly as possible. You can expect confirmation of your report within 48 hours.
1. Ongoing updates: We will keep you informed of the progress of your reported vulnerability and provide you with regular status updates.

## Confidentiality

We treat all reported vulnerabilities confidentially and ask you to do the same. Please do not share information about reported vulnerabilities publicly until we have fixed them and security updates have been released.

Thank you for your cooperation in keeping our project secure!

## What are we doing to avoid and/or close security gaps?

- Weekly CVE scans with OWASP plugin (https://owasp.org/www-project-dependency-check/)
- Regular updates of the libraries used
- Use of the Dependabot on GitHub
